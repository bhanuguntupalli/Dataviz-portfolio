# Dataviz-portfolio – SQL & Analytics Dashboard

## Problem Statement
Using a realistic, reliable dataset, create an end-to-end analytics dashboard that goes beyond simple data visualization to showcase business intelligence, sophisticated SQL skills, and analytical thinking.

Instead of merely providing data, the objective is to examine revenue performance, customer behavior, and retention trends in a way that facilitates decision-making.

## What Was Completed
- This project uses a structured, business-driven analytics strategy across several related tables to examine the **theLook eCommerce** dataset in BigQuery in order to assess revenue performance and consumer behavior.

- Growth, category contribution, top-customer concentration, cohort retention, and customer lifetime value were calculated using advanced SQL techniques (CTEs, joins, window functions, and time-based aggregations). Looker Studio was used to visualize the results, and GitHub was utilized to version-control the SQL code.

## Tech Stack Used

- **Data Source:** BigQuery Public Dataset – theLook eCommerce  
- **SQL Engine:** Google BigQuery  
- **Visualization:** Looker Studio  
- **Version Control:** GitHub
